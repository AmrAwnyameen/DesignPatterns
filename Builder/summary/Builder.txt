Builder pattern aims to “Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.” It is used to construct a complex object step by step and the final step will return the object. The process of constructing an object should be generic so that it can be used to create different representations of the same object.

Lets see an Example of Builder Design Pattern :
Consider a construction of a home. Home is the final end product (object) that is to be returned as the output of the construction process. It will have many steps like basement construction, wall construction and so on roof construction. Finally the whole home object is returned. Here using the same process you can build houses with different propertie
